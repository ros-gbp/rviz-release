  * Fixed Qt assertions triggered in debug build of Qt.
  * build: Use PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE
    Instead of using a hard-coded pkg-config to make cross-compiling
    possible where the pkg-config binary is host-prefixed (e.g.
    armv7-unknown-linux-pkg-config when cross-compiling for armv7)
  * Fix #911 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/911> #616 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/616> : TF Segfaults on reset/update
    Do not needlessly delete tree_property_ elements, update them instead.

ros-indigo-rviz (1.11.9-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Updated warning message to indicate triangle count is a 32bit integer, and not 16bit.
  * Fixed the error checking of large STL files.
  * Smoothed updates for map display plugin.
    Map displays previously only updated when receiving a message. This means that
    if your fixed frame was base_link, the costmaps would not move appropriately
    around the robot unless a message was received in order to update the transform
    that should be applied to the scene. For global costmaps, this is a slow
    update and for static maps, this never happened.
    This fixes that by hooking into rviz' periodic call to continuously update the
    transform to be applied to the scene.
  * Displays are not disabled if associated Panel becomes invisible.
    Otherwise the state between Panel & Display becomes inconsistent.
    Fixed symptom:
    When loading a configuration that contains a disabled CameraDisplay,
    during the configuration of the panel(the camera render widget),
    the panel is set visible for a very short period of time.
    Because of the missing logic, the CameraDisplay is enabled
    together with the panel, but the Display remains enabled
    after the Panel is set invisible. One ends up with an enabled
    (and subscribed) CameraDisplay without the corresponding RenderWidget,
    even so the configuration specified that the Display is not enabled.
  * Removed shortkeys from ``shortkey_to_tool_map_``
    this should fix #880 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/880>

  * Improved error checking when loading ascii stl files.
  * Suppressing some new CMake warnings by setting cmake policies.
  * Re-enable most all of the tests.
  * Added option to start rviz with the ROS logger level set to Debug
  * Fixed setting of status bar from python by checking if the original status bar is being used or not.
  * Added a third person follower view controller.
  * Fix decaying of tf2 static transforms in the TF display.
  * Correctly display color and alpha in pointclouds.
  * Restored functionality to force opacity and color for meshes that have null rgba values.
  * Use the ``find_package``'ed python version detected by catkin.
    Otherwise it might happen that catkin (and the rest of the workspace)
    uses 2.x and rviz detects & tries to use 3.x. This can produce some nasty
    collisions.
    See rospack, roslz4, qt_gui_cpp and others for similar invokation.
  * Fix processing empty of pointclouds.
    Otherwise, given a stream of clouds with some of them empty, the last non-empty message will still be displayed until a the next non-empty cloud comes in.
  * Check if position and orientation of links of robots contain NaNs when updating pose of robot links.
  * Fixed DELETEALL marker action, by not iterating on the marker list.

ros-indigo-rviz (1.11.7-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Fixed a bug where the timestamp was not set for the /initialpose message published by the 2D Pose Estimate tool.
  * Added a method/Qt Signal for refreshing tools called ``refreshTool()``.
    Calling this method updates the name and icon of a tool in the toolbar.
  * Fixed a bug with ``setCurrentTool``.
    This fixes a rare gui bug: if an incoming tool directly calls another tool during it's activate() function the tool gets changed accordingly but the toolbar gui becomes inconsistent because Tool* tool pointer is outdated in this case. using Tool* current_tool fixes this.
  * Fixed initialization of Tool's ``shortcut_key_`` and fixed a bug in ``toKeys()``.
    * Initialized the ``shortcut_key_`` param with '/0' to be able to check whether a tool has a shortkey assigned or not.
    * Made the tool manager check if a tool has a shortkey before converting the char to a key code.
    * Fixed the ``toKeys()`` method by removing the assertions, making at a boolean returning function and allowing a single key only, as this is what is to be expected from the ``shortcut_key_`` param this should fix #851 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/851>

  * Tools (on the toolbar) can now indicate if they need access to keypresses by setting the ``access_all_keys_`` attribute.
    The handling of keypresses in tools has also been refactored. See: pull request #838 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/838>
  * Path display now has an additional display style called "Billboards" which allows to set the line width of the paths.
    It also now has an offset property to shift the path with regard to the fixed frame origin.
    See: pull request #842 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/842>
  * Meshes now have their ambient values scaled by 0.5 which gives a softer look, which is more in line with Gazebo's look and feel.
    See: pull request #841 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/841>

  * Fixed stereo support for custom projection matrices
  * Fixed read off end of array in triangle_list_marker
  * Add dependency on opengl
    rviz calls find_package(OpenGL), so it should have a direct dependency
    on OpenGL. This matters on ARM, where the other packages that rviz
    depends on use OpenGL.ES, and don't provide a transitive dependency on
    OpenGL.
  * Update map via QT signal instead of in ros thread
    Resolved issues when running RViz in rqt where the incomingMap callback
    is not issued from RViz's main QThread causing a crash in Ogre. Map
    updates are now handled by emitting a signal to update the map from the
    callback thread.
  * fix rainbow color, see #813 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/813>

  * remove explicit dependency on urdfdom
    urdfdom is provided via urdf and catkin_* CMake variables.
    The current setup was unbalanced anyways because along with urdfdom, urdfdom_headers should have been being depended on and used.
    This precipitated from urdfdom's rosdep key changing as it became a system dependency in Indigo.
  * Add ability to delete all markers in Marker plugin
  * fix hidden cursor bug
    On some systems loading a pixmap from an svg file can fail.  On these machines
    an empty cursor results, meaning the cursor is invisible inside Rviz.  This
    works around the problem by using an arrow cursor when the desired cursor
    pixmap canot be loaded.

  * Eigen is now found using the FindEigen.cmake from the cmake_modules package.

    For more information see this commit: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/commit/9cfaf78e2ae8d34e4481de19568b353964846842
  * Added a "Queue Size" option for the Range display type.
  * Added Ogre-1.10 compatibility
    This allows rviz to compile (and work) against Ogre 1.10 (currently
    the latest version of ogre).
    It also still works with earlier versions of Ogre (tested with Ogre
    1.7.4 as installed via debs on Ubuntu 12.04).
  * Now includes ogre without OGRE prefix
    This is necessary to find Ogre files in the right place with
    compatibility between Ogre < 1.9 and Ogre >= 1.9.
    This is also necessary when 2 versions of Ogre are installed on the
    build machine.
  * RVIZ doesn't use __connection_header from incoming messages, but only uses ros::MessageEvent's
  * Better feature detection for assimp version
    The unified headers were introduced in Assimp 2.0.1150, so checking for Assimp 3.0.0 is not quite the best solution.
